# Banned-Book-Personal-Project

Welcome to my Banned Book Personal Project. The focus of this project was to find the best model to classify books as banned or not banned based off the synopsis of the book. The data for this project was collected manually. 50 banned books and 50 non-banned books were selected to analyize. 

In this repository, you will find the notebook file and the csv file with the data.
